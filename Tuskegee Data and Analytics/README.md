# Historical-Analysis-of-Lynchings-in-America-Statistics-Causes-and-Trends-1882-1968-

The source for the data is http://archive.tuskegee.edu/repository/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Lynchings-Stats-Year-Dates-Causes.pdf. I selected this source mainly because it comes from a reputable university, and within the scope of this specific topic, the dataset is considered the Gold Standard for this type of analysis. Of course, additional sources exist and will be incorporated over time, as this is a high-resolution dataset. With that in mind, here are some key points about this dataset:

- It does not provide specific information for each individual.
- The data collection was based on newspaper reports, legal and governmental records, NAACP and civil rights organizations, eyewitness accounts, and sociological studies.
- This dataset likely suffers from underreporting, strong media bias, and a lack of standardized record-keeping, as there was no formal government tracking system during the period covered.
  
As with any descriptive summaries or exploratory data analysis (EDA), it is remarkably easy to derive broad, sweeping claims from a limited dataset like this one. While this dataset offers valuable insight into where, when, and to whom these events occurred, it remains subject to bias, underreporting, and other limitations. Lastly, the datasets are directly created from the official PDF from the Tustkegee Archives. There are three separate datasets given the structure within the file.
